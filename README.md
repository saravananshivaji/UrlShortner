# UrlShortner
This code uses Google API to shorten the url. I did this to send links as SMS to avoid the encode / decode issues due to the spaces


In UrlShortner class replace the following two variabled in the main method

    String apiKey = "Enter your API Key"; // this will be your API Key.
		String longUrl = "Enter your long url here"; // This will be the long URL which you need to Shorten.
